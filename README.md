# Maat
A simple build system for the Functional language

Written over few days, so probably really buggy. But it worked on my computer.

# Usage
You can download the executable from Releases (last version 0.0.1).
Running `./maat help` will print the built-in help info.

To try a basic project in functional run this:
```
./maat init
# Now enter your project name
cd project-name
../maat run
```

# Portability
Maat was tested on Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu, but it should work on any Windows or Linux version, OSX is untested.
The code itself contains many comments starting with `TODO` so there is certainly work to do.
